"""
The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of N daily price quotes
for a stock and we need to calculate the span of the stockâ€™s price for all N days. The span Si of the stockâ€™s price
on a given day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price
of the stock on the current day is less than its price on the given day.
Input: N = 7, price[] = [100 80 60 70 60 75 85]
Output: 1 1 1 2 1 4 6
So we need to find the consecutive smaller or equal before it
